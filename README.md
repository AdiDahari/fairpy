# fairpy
An open-source library of [fair division algorithms](references.md) in Python.
To install:

    sudo python3 setup.py install
 
For each algorithm in file `x.py` there is a demo program `x_demo.py`. For example, try:

    python3 cut_and_choose_demo.py
    python3 last_diminisher_demo.py
    
See [references.md](references.md) for a complete list of algorithms and their implementation status.
