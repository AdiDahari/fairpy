        Accepts a consumption graph and tries to find a proportional allocation.
        Uses cvxpy to solve a linear program.
        The condition for the program is:
        1) each alloc[i][j] >=0 - an agent cannot get a negative amount of some item.
        2) if consumption_graph[i][j] == 0 then alloc[i][j]= 0 .
           If in the current consumption graph the agent i doesnt consume the item j,
           then in the allocation he gets 0% from this item.
        3) The proportional condition (by definition).
        4) The sum of every column in the allocation == 1:
           Exactly 100 percent of each item are allocated.
        After solving the problem, check if the results are better than the
        "min_sharing_allocation"  (meaning if the current allocation has lass sharing than "min_sharing_allocation")
        and update it if needed.
